    <string name="troubleshoot">If the strobe light isn\'t working for you, try these settings. DROID phones will almost definitely need the preview hack. The gentle
        strobe is new and is for phones whose drivers can be easily overwhelmed by LED commands.
       	\n\nIn any case, if you are having trouble, I still love getting these emails. (The email is already 
        filled out for you.)</string>

    <string name="beta_testing">This summer I\'m going to be completely rewriting this app with all the new skillz I\'ve picked up.
        But with any complete rewrite, it\'s important to test it out before giving it to the general public to avoid one-stars.
        I need some people who enjoy this app to become my beta testers and try out the new version.
        \nPros:
        \n - The new version will be <b>awesome</b>
        \n - You\'ll get to see it a few months early
        \nCons:
        \n - It might not work right
        \n\nSo if you\'re interested, click the link below. You always have the choice to leave the beta if you get annoyed.</string>
        
    <string name="new_version_text">- Fixed flashing with app closed on newer phones

    <string name="turntable_text">Welcome to the Strobily turntable calibrator. This is for calibrating your record-playing
        turntables. To begin, you\'ll need to attach a pattern to your turntable. A good start would be to search \"strobe calibrate 
        turntable\" on Google.</string>
        
    <string name="turntable_text2">Select the highest frequency that is green, then adjust your turntable until the pattern appears 
        to stop moving.</string>
        
    <string name="widget_text">Welcome to the Strobily widget creator. This page allows you to set any of your saved <b>patterns</b>

    <string name="tacho_help_1">This part of the app uses sound to identify the frequency of a spinning object. To use it, find a spinning
        object that is making a sound and press one of the four buttons to take a sound sample.
        \n\nWhen the results appear, the first number is the frequency that was identified and the other buttons represent fractions of that frequency.
        The greener a button is, the stronger that frequency was identified. (However if they\'re all green, most likely no match was found.) Normal-colored
        buttons did not rank in the top 5.
        \n\nIf your spinning object is not making a sound, you may have to intervene. An example would be sticking a playing card into a fan in order
        to make a repeating sound.
        \n\nThe Strobe Frequency Offset allows you to flash at a slightly different frequency than your spinning object such that it will appear to slowly spin.
        This value is only applied when you select a frequency (it doesn\'t affect detection).

        This graph show what the app was doing during the past 100 flashes. The x-axis width is set so that it exactly
        matches the frequency of the strobe.
        \n\nThink of each row as 1 bar of music. The LED needs to turn fully-on and fully-off within 1 bar to keep up with the tempo.
        If the tempo is too fast, the LED falls behind and isn\'t able to turn on and off before the next row starts.
        \n\nPerfect performance will be a white vertical line. Diagonal lines mean it\'s not keeping up.
